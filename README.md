# University-Networking-Project

Along with the constant development of social economy, computer networks
have changed people’s lifestyle in many aspects. Local area networks, which are
widely applied, play a more and more important role in medical treatment,
military, education and science. Not only enterprises and companies build LANs,
but also school, college, families and schools establish their own small LANs.
With LANs, work and study efficiency is improved, but it also brings some
problems. Wired local area networks couldn’t work without the cable, which
means that we couldn’t change the structure of networks casually according to
actual situations. Therefore, we cannot implement mobile office and studies.
Compared with local area networks, wireless local area networks offer
advantages at different places. One of the advantages of a wireless local area
network is that if there is coverage of WLAN, users can move anywhere they
want with their devices and transmit data at the same time.
This project designs the wireless campus network for campus. The project
introduces basic knowledge of wireless LAN, designing and planning a wireless
local area network based on the actual situation of the campus.
